Below are a handful of lecture notes and paper discussions that I found clarifying to write: 
- **Notes on Time-Series Econometrics**: Hansen's lectures were notation-heavy and, at times, overwhelming. Tightly organizing the subject matter helped me better follow proofs and better understand the broader course themes: 
    - Part I
    - Part II
    - Part III
- **Formalization & Discussion of "Algorithmic Discrimination and Input Accountability under the Civil Rights Acts" (Bartlett et al., 2020)**: I found the authors' project of interpreting the law in an econometric fashion to be compelling. I formalize this effort to both elaborate and complicate their work.
