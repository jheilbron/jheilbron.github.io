Below are a handful of lecture notes and paper discussions that I found clarifying to write: 
- **Notes on Time-Series Econometrics**: Hansen's lectures were notation-heavy and, at times, overwhelming. Tightly organizing (a subset of) the subject matter helped me better follow proofs and better understand the broader course themes: 
    1. Stochastic Processes, Stationarity and Ergodicity, and the Birkhoff LLN: [heilbron_hansen_notes_1](https://github.com/jheilbron/jheilbron.github.io/raw/master/downloads/heilbron_hansen_notes_1_lln.pdf)
    2. Additive and Multiplicative Processes, Martingales, and the Billingsley CLT: [heilbron_hansen_notes_2](https://github.com/jheilbron/jheilbron.github.io/raw/master/downloads/heilbron_hansen_notes_2_clt.pdf)
    3. The General Method of Moments: [heilbron_hansen_notes_3](https://github.com/jheilbron/jheilbron.github.io/raw/master/downloads/heilbron_hansen_notes_3_gmm.pdf)


- **Formalization & Discussion of "Algorithmic Discrimination and Input Accountability under the Civil Rights Acts" (Bartlett et al., 2020)**: I found the authors' project of interpreting the law in an econometric fashion to be compelling. I formalize this effort to both elaborate and complicate their work.
