Below are a handful of miscellaneous notes that I found clarifying to write: 
- **Bibliography on Central Counterparties (CCPs)**: The literature on financial market infrastructures (FMIs) and central counterparties (CCPs) is narrow, insular, somewhat interdisciplinary, and in many cases unpublished. For this reason, citations of interest are fairly dispersed. To help lower barriers to entry on this topic, I have compiled a (non-exhaustive) bibliography. Where available, I've included abstracts.

- **Research Note on Housing Hedonics, Financial Frictions, and Discrete Choice Econometrics**: I elaborate a standard discrete choice framework to identify parameters describing both preferences and constraints. Estimation can be accomplished in a 2SLS regression with appropriately chosen instruments. I attempt to apply the framework to the simultaneous problem of neighborhood and mortgage choice. The results contradict downward sloping individual demand curves, and so I conclude I have not yet found satisfactory instruments.

- **Notes on Time-Series Econometrics**: Hansen's lectures were notation-heavy and, at times, overwhelming. Tightly organizing (a subset of) the subject matter helped me better follow proofs and better understand the broader course themes: 

    1. Stochastic Processes, Stationarity and Ergodicity, and the Birkhoff LLN: [hansen_notes_1](https://github.com/jheilbron/jheilbron.github.io/raw/master/downloads/heilbron_hansen_notes_1_lln.pdf)

    2. Additive and Multiplicative Processes, Martingales, and the Billingsley CLT: [hansen_notes_2](https://github.com/jheilbron/jheilbron.github.io/raw/master/downloads/heilbron_hansen_notes_2_clt.pdf) 

    3. The Generalized Method of Moments: [hansen_notes_3](https://github.com/jheilbron/jheilbron.github.io/raw/master/downloads/heilbron_hansen_notes_3_gmm.pdf)

- **Formalization & Discussion of "Algorithmic Accountability" (Bartlett et al., 2019)**: I found the authors' project of interpreting the law in an econometric fashion to be compelling. I formalize this effort to both elaborate and complicate their work.
