We show that a lack of position transparency results in a counterparty risk externality, that manifests itself in the form of excess “leverage,” in that parties take on short positions that lead to levels of default risk that are higher than Pareto efficient ones. This externality is absent when trading is organized via a centralized clearing mechanism that provides transparency of trade positions. Collateral requirements and especially subordination of non-transparent positions in bankruptcy can ameliorate the counterparty risk externality in market settings such as over-the-counter \(OTC\) markets which feature a lack of position transparency.},

In response, regulators have proposed requiring the formation of a central clearinghouse to share default risk on these contracts.  A comparative economic analysis of the costs and benefits of alternative default risk sharing mechanisms casts considerable doubt on the advisability of central clearing of credit derivatives.  These products are likely to be subject to severe information asymmetry problems regarding their value, risk, and the creditworthiness of those who trade them, and these information asymmetries are likely to be less severe in bilateral markets than in centrally cleared systems.  Moreover, although regulators have argued that clearing would reduce systemic risk, a more complete analysis demonstrates that clearing could actually increase risks to the broader financial system.},

This chapter reviews some alternative approaches to the design of insolvency and failure resolution regimes for CCPs.

I discuss how one might adapt to CCPs some of the failure resolution approaches currently being designed for other forms of systemically important financial institutions.

Most creditors are “stayed” from enforcing their rights while a firm is in bankruptcy. However, many derivatives contracts are exempt from these stays. Furthermore, derivatives enjoy netting and closeout, or termination, privileges which are not always available to most other creditors. The primary argument used to motivate passage of legislation granting these extraordinary protections is that derivatives markets are a major source of systemic risk in financial markets and that netting and closeout reduce this risk. To date, these assertions have not been subjected to rigorous economic scrutiny. This paper critically re-examines this hypothesis. These relationships are more complex than often perceived. We conclude that it is not clear whether netting, collateral, and/or closeout lead to reduced systemic risk, once the impact of these protections on the size and structure of the derivatives market has been taken into account.},

We introduce a criterion for the resilience of a large financial network to the insolvency of a small group of financial institutions and quantify how contagion amplifies small shocks to the network.

Building on these conditions, we characterize the minimum bailout payments needed to ensure systemic solvency, as well as how solvency can be ensured by guaranteeing a specific set of debt payments. Bailout injections needed to eliminate self-fulfilling cycles of defaults (credit freezes) are fully recoverable, while those needed to prevent cascading defaults outside of cycles are not. We show that the minimum bailout problem is computationally hard, but provide an upper bound on optimal payments and show that the problem has intuitive solutions in specific network structures such as those with disjoint cycles or a core-periphery structure.},

Bank failures have led in recent years to a disruption of the financial system and a significant spillover of financial distress to the larger economy (Hellwig, 2009). Regulators have had great difficulties anticipating the impact of defaults partly due to a lack of visibility on the structure of the financial system as well as a lack of a methodology for monitoring systemic risk. The complexity of the contemporary financial systems makes it a challenge to define adequate indicators of systemic risk that could help in an objective assessment of the systemic importance of financial institutions and an objective framework for assessing the efficiency of macro-prudential policies.},

We show how the size and structure of these markets can undergo rapid and extensive changes when participants engage in portfolio compression, which is an optimization technology that exploits multilateral netting opportunities. We find that tightly knit and concentrated trading structures, as featured by many large over-the-counter markets, are especially susceptible to reductions of notional amounts and network reconfigurations resulting from compression activities. Using a unique transaction-level data set on credit-default-swaps markets, we estimate reduction levels, suggesting that the adoption of this technology can account for a large share of the historical development observed in these markets since the global financial crisis. Finally, we test the effect of a mandate to centrally clear over the counter markets in terms of size and structure. When participants engage in both central clearing and portfolio compression with the clearinghouse, we find large netting failures if clearinghouses proliferate. Allowing for compression across clearinghouses by and large offsets this adverse effect.},

  abstract   = {We study the impact of central clearing of over-the-counter (OTC) transactions on counterparty exposures in a market with OTC transactions across several asset classes with heterogeneous characteristics. We find that the impact, on total expected interdealer exposure, of introducing a central counterparty (CCP) for a single class of OTC derivatives is sensitive to assumptions on heterogeneity of asset classes in terms of `riskyness' of the asset class as well as correlation of exposures across asset classes. In particular, while an analysis assuming independent, homogeneous exposures suggests that central clearing is efficient only if  one has an unrealistically high number of participants,  the opposite conclusion is reached if differences in riskyness and correlation across asset classes are realistically taken into account. Empirically plausible specifications of these parameters lead to the conclusion that the gain from multilateral netting in a CCP overweighs the loss of netting across asset classes in bilateral netting agreements. When a CCP exists for interest rate derivatives, adding a CCP for credit derivatives is shown to decrease overall exposures. These findings are shown to be robust to the choice of distribution for OTC derivatives exposures.},

The estimated collateral demands include initial margin and the frictional demands associated with the movement of variation margin through the network of market participants. We estimate the impact on total collateral demand of more widespread initial margin requirements, increased novation of CDS to central clearing parties (CCPs), an increase in the number of clearing members, the proliferation of CCPs of both specialized and non-specialized types, collateral rehypothecation practices, and client clearing. System-wide collateral demand is increased significantly by the application of initial margin requirements for dealers, whether or not the CDS are cleared. Given these dealer-to-dealer initial margin requirements, mandatory central clearing is shown to lower, not raise, system-wide collateral demand, provided there is no significant proliferation of CCPs. Central clearing does, however, have significant distributional consequences for collateral requirements across market participants.},

The dominance of a few big players in the chains of insurance and reinsurance for CDS credit risk mitigation for banks' assets has led to the idea of too interconnected to fail (TITF) resulting, as in the case of AIG, of a tax payer bailout. We provide an empirical reconstruction of the US CDS network based on the FDIC Call Reports for off balance sheet bank data for the 4th quarter in 2007 and 2008. The propagation of financial contagion in networks with dense clustering which reflects high concentration or localization of exposures between few participants will be identified as one that is TITF. Those that dominate in terms of network centrality and connectivity are called 'super-spreaders'. Management of systemic risk from bank failure in uncorrelated random networks is different to those with clustering. As systemic risk of highly connected financial firms in the CDS (or any other) financial markets is not priced into their holding of capital and collateral, we design a super-spreader tax based on eigenvector centrality of the banks which can mitigate potential socialized losses.},

Price discovery can be analyzed in the FCVAR model by a relatively straightforward examination of the adjustment coefficients. In our empirical analysis, we use the data from Figuerola-Ferretti and Gonzalo (2010), who conduct a similar analysis using the usual (non-fractional) CVAR model. Our first finding is that, for all markets except copper, the fractional integration parameter is highly significant, showing that the usual, non-fractional model is not appropriate. Next, when allowing for fractional integration in the long-run equilibrium relations, fewer lags are needed in the autoregressive formulation, further stressing the usefulness of the fractional model. Compared to the results from the non-fractional model, we find slightly more evidence of price discovery in the spot market. Specifically, using standard likelihood ratio tests, we do not reject the hypothesis that price discovery takes place exclusively in the spot (futures) market for copper, lead, and zinc (aluminum and nickel).},

Our model shows that while derivatives are value-enhancing risk management tools, super-seniority for derivatives is generally inefficient: collateralization and e¤ective seniority of derivatives shifts credit risk to the firm's creditors, even though it is more efficient if this risk is borne by derivative counterparties. In addition, because super-senior derivatives dilute existing creditors, they may lead firms to take on derivative positions that are too large from a social perspective.

This framework supplements conventional standards of risk management such as Cover 2 and provides a comparative and comprehensive approach to assessing risk protection across CCPs that is not predicated on a specific number of member defaults. We apply the approach to a wide range of CCPs in different geographical jurisdictions and asset classes and find that there are substantial differences in protection coverage. In particular, large European CCPs appear to be significantly safer than their counterparts in Asia-Pacific and North America. These differences are also reflected in supervisory data that provide CCP members’ risk assessments of the CCPs to which they belong.},

We show that any potential harmfulness of portfolio compression arises from contagion effects. We show how portfolio compression affects systemic risk depends on the resilience of nodes taking part in compression, on the proportion of debt that they can repay, and on the recovery rates in case of default. In particular, the potential danger of portfolio compression comes from defaults of firms that conduct portfolio compression. If no defaults occur among the firms that engage in compression, then portfolio compression always reduces systemic risk.},

But it also imposes liquidity demands on market participants that, occasionally, could worsen financial stress during flight-to-safety episodes or lead to destabilising margin spirals.

  volume   = {34},
  abstract = {A central question for corporate law scholarship has revolved around the ownership structure of enterprises. Why are some businesses owned by employees, some by customers, and some by investors? Until now, the question has centered on the relative benefits offered to these stakeholders by one form or another. This Article explores how ownership structure can be a matter of public importance for financial stability, and proves that it is so by delving into an institution of immense importance and timeliness: the clearinghouse, a critical financial market infrastructure.
Clearinghouses process, settle, and guarantee the performance of several trillion dollars in securities and derivatives trades daily. By operating as central counterparties, they act as private stability mechanisms, reducing counterparty credit risk and sharing default risk among their members. Clearinghouses achieve this result via a unique economic structure, which includes a double layer of capital: the traditional equity capital and the so-called mutual guaranty fund (the clearinghouse’s loss sharing fund).
Historically, clearinghouses have been mutual enterprises owned by their members (users), who contributed to the firm’s mutual guaranty fund. But most clearinghouses have recently demutualized their ownership structure, opening their equity capital to external investors and transforming into for-profit public corporations, while keeping members on the hook for losses. This structural evolution has catalyzed new agency costs between the now coexisting and “competing” stakeholders: members and external shareholders. These costs, which have been further exacerbated by the post-crisis systemic role of clearinghouses, are exemplified by shareholders with control and economic rights but limited “skin in the game,” and members who bear the final risk and losses if things go south, but who have no control or monitoring rights. This Article identifies how the agency costs between members and shareholders threaten the financial stability of clearinghouses and argues that aligning control and monitoring rights with final risk-bearing costs is the path clearinghouses should follow to achieve a more resilient ownership and governance structure.},

  abstract  = {In March 2022, nickel prices on the London Metal Exchange (LME) nearly quadrupled in just three trading days, threatening to put several clearing members into default and exhaust the default fund at LME Clear, the exchange's central counterparty (CCP). The LME responded in an unprecedented fashion, by cancelling eight hours of nickel market trades. Though challenged in court, its authority to do so was ultimately upheld. This paper documents the market stress and LME's response in order to understand the implications of the trade cancellation decision for financial stability and CCP powers going forward. While LME's trade cancellation helped to alleviate distress, its decision runs counter to the function of a CCP, which is to ensure contract performance. In upholding LME's right to void contracts, the court's verdict could change how CCP rule books are applied under financial distress, potentially creating scope for moral hazard or other adverse consequences.},

  abstract = {Among the reforms to over-the-counter (OTC) derivative markets since the global financial crisis is a commitment to collateralise counterparty exposures and to clear standardised contracts via central counterparties (CCPs). The reforms aim to reduce interconnectedness and improve counterparty risk management in these important markets. At the same time, however, the reforms necessarily concentrate risk in one or a few CCPs and also increase institutions’ demand for high-quality assets to meet collateral requirements. This paper looks more closely at the implications of these reforms for the stability of the financial network. Following Heath, Kelly and Manning (2013), the paper examines liquidity and solvency risk under alternative clearing configurations, but extends the analysis in two main ways. First, rather than using simulated data, it uses actual data on the derivative positions of the 41 largest bank participants in global OTC derivative markets in 2012 (as previously used by the Bank for International Settlements’ Macroeconomic Assessment Group on Derivatives). Second, it extends the methodology to consider in greater depth the implications of loss allocation by CCPs to meet obligations once pre-funded financial resources have been exhausted, and in particular the mechanism of variation margin gains haircutting. This mechanism is considered in international standard-setters’ guidance on recovery planning for CCPs and has been adopted by some CCPs. The paper demonstrates that designing and operating CCPs in accordance with international standards can limit the potential for stress to propagate through the system, even in very extreme market conditions.},

Our framework, which is based on a modern approach to extreme value theory, is used to design CCP skin-in-the-game (SITG). We show that under inadequate SITG levels, members are more exposed to default losses than CCPs. The resulting risk management incentive distortions could be mitigated by using the proposed SITG formulations. Our analysis addresses investor-owned and member-owned CCPs, we also analyze multilayered and monolayer default waterfalls. Viewing the total size of SITG as the lower bound on CCP regulatory capital, the framework can be used to improve capital regulation of investor-owned and member-owned CCPs. We also demonstrate that bank capital rules for CCP exposures may underestimate risk. The broader central clearing mandate of U.S. Treasuries may take place under monolayer CCPs. These clearinghouses may need to allocate more of their own capital to the default waterfall.},

Margin requirementsare a CCP’s first line of defense against the default of a counterparty. To capture liquiditycosts at default, margin requirements need to increase superlinearly in position size. However,convex margin requirements create an incentive for a swaps dealer to split its positions acrossmultiple CCPs, effectively “hiding” potential liquidation costs from each CCP. To compensate,each CCP needs to set higher margin requirements than it would in isolation. In a model withtwo CCPs, we define an equilibrium as a pair of margin schedules through which both CCPscollect sufficient margin under a dealer’s optimal allocation of trades. In the case of linear priceimpact, we show that a necessary and sufficient condition for the existence of an equilibrium isthat the two CCPs agree on liquidity costs, and we characterize all equilibria when this holds.A difference in views can lead to a race to the bottom. We provide extensions of this result anddiscuss its implications for CCP oversight and risk management.},

Consequently, bilaterally netted exposures to the core increase. The regulation also makes the CCP more exposed to the core than the periphery was pre-regulation. This endogenous network reaction to the regulation creates the unanticipated effect of reducing financial stability through more frequent coordination failures that start at the core and spread to the periphery and the CCP.

Criticsmount two main objections: a clearinghouse shifts risk instead of reducingit; and a clearinghouse could fail, requiring a bailout. This Article’sobservation that clearinghouses engage in liquidity partitioning answersboth. Liquidity partitioning means that when one of its member firms becomesbankrupt, a clearinghouse keeps a portion of the firm’s most liquidassets, and a matching portion of its short-term debt, out of the bankruptcyestate. The clearinghouse then applies the first toward immediate repaymentof the second. Economic value is created because creditors within theclearinghouse are paid much more quickly, and other creditors are paid noless quickly, than they would be otherwise. The rapid cash payouts forclearinghouse members reduce illiquidity and uncertainty in the financialsector, the main causes of contagion in a crisis. And because the clearinghouseholds only liquid assets, it avoids the maturity mismatch betweenshort-term liabilities and long-term assets that characterizes the balance sheetsof many financial institutions. A clearinghouse therefore is much less likelythan its members to fail during a crisis. To ensure that clearinghouses remainstable and systemically valuable, rulemakers should require clearing ofa wide variety of derivatives contracts, but should limit clearinghouse membershipto dealer firms.},

The procedures ensure the regularity of the settlement process through the prudent and orderly closeout of the defaulter's portfolio. Traditional approaches to CCPs' margin requirements typically assume a simple closeout profile, and do not account for the 'real-life' constraints embedded on the management of a default. The paper proposes an approach of evaluating how distinct closeout strategies may expose a CCP to different sets of risk and costs, and consequently could impact the sufficiency of financial resources to cover its risk exposure to a default. The approach is based on a counterfactual simulation, and evaluates a full spectrum of hedging strategies in an exploratory and model-free manner, deriving endogenous and market-dependent risk metrics. Using the trade repository data available to the Bank (as a result of EMIR reporting) on over-the-counter (OTC) interest rate swaps (IRS) and ten years (ie 2005 to 2015) of information on related market risk factors, the paper derives empirically an efficient hedging strategy that minimizes the CCP's risk exposure to a defaulting clearing member. Endogenous trade-off structures between total risk (market risk plus funding needs) and transaction costs are also established, with marginal sensitivities to individual components of the hedging strategy determined.},

This pattern is procyclical, intensifying with market volatility and driving up repo rates. In the backward phase, CCPs comply with regulations by safely investing their cash holdings primarily in reverse repos, followed by safe bonds and, to a lesser extent, central bank deposits. The return of cash by CCPs, back to financial markets via reverse repos and bond purchases, exerts downward pressure on repo rates. Overall, our findings demonstrate that CCPs have become important non-bank entities, impacting funding markets, with significant implications for financial stability and policymaking.},

Under our assumptions regarding bidders' behaviour, although the revenue of the portfolio by the CCP might be the same for these auction formats mentioned above, there could be significant differences in the externalities arising from each of them. Additionally, this paper considers how mechanisms to incentivize competitive bidding could, in some circumstances, have adverse implications for financial stability by inefficiently distributing losses to surviving clearing members.

  abstract  = {After the global financial crisis, bank regulation became more stringent, and as a result the traditional banking system was well capitalized leading into the COVID-19 pandemic. But these same regulatory changes also incentivized a continuing migration of traditional banking activities to nonbank financial institutions (NBFIs), where looser regulation allowed for dangerous buildups of systemic risk. These risks were then realized across many NBFIs and markets in 2020. While legislation to harmonize regulation across these different domains would be desirable, we do not believe it likely in the foreseeable future. In this paper we propose a congruence principle for financial regulation, whereby regulators use existing statutory authority to coordinate rules across economically similar instruments. We provide examples of how such congruence could work for the cases of nonprime mortgage finance and the markets for US Treasury securities.},

  abstract  = {This paper studies the spread of losses and defaults in financial networks with two interrelated features: collateral requirements and alternative contract termination rules. When collateral is committed to a firm’s counterparties, a solvent firm may default if it lacks sufficient liquid assets to meet its payment obligations. Collateral requirements can, thus, increase defaults and payment shortfalls. Moreover, one firm may benefit from the failure of another if the failure frees collateral committed by the surviving firm, giving it additional resources to make other payments. Contract termination at default may also improve the ability of other firms to meet their obligations through access to collateral. As a consequence of these features, the timing of payments and collateral liquidation must be carefully specified to establish the existence of payments that clear the network. Using this framework, we show that dedicated collateral may lead to more defaults than pooled collateral, we study the consequences of illiquid collateral for the spread of losses through fire sales, we compare networks with and without selective contract termination, and we analyze the impact of alternative resolution and bankruptcy stay rules that limit the seizure of collateral at default. Under an upper bound on derivatives leverage, full termination reduces payment shortfalls compared with selective termination.},

We illustrate stress transmission mechanisms using simple examples as well as empirical evidence based on calibrated data. Furthermore, we show how stress mitigation tools such as variation margin gains haircutting by one CCP can have spillover effects on other CCPs. The framework can be used to enhance CCP stress-testing, which currently relies on the “Cover 2” standard requiring CCPs to be able to withstand the default of their two largest clearing members. We show that who these two clearing members are can be significantly affected if one considers higher-order effects arising from interconnectedness through shared clearing membership. Looking at the full network of CCPs and shared clearing members is, therefore, important from a financial stability perspective.},

We estimate the total amount of contagion, the marginal contribution of each firm to contagion, and the number of defaulting firms for a systemic shock to credit spreads. A novel feature of the model is that it allows for a range of behavioral responses to balance sheet stress, including delayed or partial payments.

In contrast to many existing models, it allows for the spread of contagion already before the point of default and hence can account for contagion due to distress and mark-to-market losses. We derive general ordering results for outcome measures of stress tests that enable us to compare different contagion mechanisms. We use these results to study the sensitivity of the new contagion mechanism with respect to its model parameters and to compare it to existing models in the literature. When applying the new model to data from the European Banking Authority, we find that the risk from distress contagion is strongly dependent on the anticipated recovery rate. For low recovery rates, the high additional losses caused by bankruptcy dominate the overall stress test results. For high recovery rates, however, we observe a strong sensitivity of the stress test outcomes with respect to the model parameters determining the magnitude of distress contagion.},

Fundamental changes in regulatory and financial stability policy in thewake of the crisis of 2008-9 have led clearing members to reassess their role in CCP default management. This, in turn, has led to skirmishes between some CCPs and clearing members over a variety of risk-related issues. Policy responses to this conflict should focus primarily on the incentives of both CCPs and clearing members to participate collaboratively in CCP default management, and on the overall resilience of central clearing arrangements. Continued conflict over governance may make it impossible for a CCP in crisis to recover and may also hinder resolution efforts.},

The key node-level quantities are asset size, leverage, and a financial connectivity measure given by the fraction of a financial institution’s liabilities held by other financial institutions. We combine these measures to derive explicit bounds on the potential magnitude of network effects on contagion and loss amplification. Spillover effects are most significant when node sizes are heterogeneous and the originating node is highly leveraged and has high financial connectivity. Our results also highlight the importance of mechanisms that go beyond simple spillover effects to magnify shocks; these include bankruptcy costs, and mark-to-market losses resulting from credit quality deterioration or a loss of confidence. We illustrate the results with data on the European banking system.},

This article argues that the interaction between underlying law and this new regulation needs to be addressed in order to advance the objectives of the reforms. The starting point for the argument is the two techniques that underpin CCPs: limited access and posting assets, or margin. Having established that access via intermediated or ‘client’ clearing will become increasingly important with mandatory clearing, the article explores the impact of client clearing on the legal rules governing the margin posted by users of a CCP. The detail of the interaction between European regulations on CCP clearing and the UK rules on client assets is considered as an example. The dilemma identified arises because regulation, designed to improve financial stability by mandating clearing, may potentially undermine certain ways in which CCPs promote that outcome. The article concludes that the interaction between underlying law and new regulation needs to be accounted for and addressed at EU level, in order to safeguard the functions that attracted regulators to clearing in the first place.},

This paper argues that one cause of this complexity is that the public sector is seeking to incorporate into legislation (and require the wider use of) a privately owned and operated risk management mechanism. As a matter of law, the paper argues that CCP clearing can be understood as a market-generated ‘legal device’; in other words, one designed to support the markets by means of the interaction of various private law techniques. Following this analysis through, the paper highlights the benefits and drawbacks which derive from the legal techniques underlying CCP clearing (standardisation of contracts, asset-backing, netting, and so on) and argues that these qualities are inherent to the device. It concludes that the inherent capacity of CCP clearing gives rise to a qualitatively different set of challenges for policymakers than those arising from technical implementation, and it explains that both types of problem need to be addressed if the CCP prescription is to be effective.},

It shows first that under the powers granted to a central counterparty (CCP) by its rule-book, the need for CCP capital is primarily driven by the nondefault loss exposure profile, and not necessarily by the quantum of cleared positions. Further, it demonstrates that there is only limited potential to increase the SITG at a CCP, given that it is a private institution  that must return the equity cost of capital to the market to continue in business. In practice, this restricts the ability to mandate higher SITG for CCPs, for if no private  sector CCP can meet the cost of equity capital, then the clearing solution  needs to be provided by the taxpayer, which is an unacceptable outcome. Finally, this paper calculates the trade-off between increasing SITG and increasing clearing costs to members, to compensate the CCP for returns falling below the equity cost of capital. It establishes that a substantial  increase in SITG over current levels would require  a corresponding  substantial  increase in clearing fees across the financial  sector.},

The three commonly found elements of the waterfall (initial margin, CCP capital at risk or “skin-in-the-game” (SITG), and default fund (DF)) are introduced, and the impact of varying the proportions of each element is discussed. The model suggests that, under reasonable assumptions, CCPs want SITG to be as low as possible, while clearing members prefer services where it plays a larger role in the default waterfall. In our setting, lower levels of SITG lead to a higher CCP return on equity but reduced levels of clearing. Moreover, CCPs have an incentive to keep initial margin higher than the required minimum, as this reduces the risk of DF losses without putting CCP capital at risk. The analysis presented suggests that a regulatory minimum requirement for SITG could play a role in incentivizing the use of CCPs where a clearing mandate does not apply and regulatory capital incentives to clear do not bite.},

The paper proceeds by analysing the precedential effects of these decisions, and it reports on a recent workshop held at the London School of Economics that met to consider this question. Subject to the event’s terms of engagement, the paper draws out several themes from the discussion, including the impact of the Lehmans cases on the principles of contractual interpretation, the law of trusts and insolvency law. By way of conclusion, it is submitted that the impact of Lehmans case law reaches far beyond that particular insolvency, to worldwide users of standard form documents, the global financial markets and the common law itself.

  issn      = {2049-5404},
  abstract  = {At the Pittsburgh Summit in 2009, G20 leaders agreed to wide-reaching reforms to over-the-counter (OTC) derivatives markets. One of these reforms required the clearing of standardized OTC derivatives through central counterparties (CCPs). Since then, CCPs have become increasingly important. There has been an extensive programme of regulatory change affecting CCPs, OTC derivatives markets and their participants. As OTC clearing has grown, tension has increased between different classes of market participants over the traditional CCP model of resource provision through loss mutualization. We argue that most of this tension can be explained by a misalignment between the policy goal of enhancing financial stability and the delivery of that goal by mandating clearing through CCPs as they are currently organized. Specifically, the traditional model for resource provision makes most CCPs suitable for managing “club goods”, whereas financial stability is a “public good”. The key differences between these two types of goods, driven by the wedge between those who pay for them and those who derive the benefits, create the observed tensions. Based on this analysis, we propose a framework to analyze the functional elements of a CCP and examine whether an alternative clearing model might be more effective. We conclude that incentives would be better aligned if the functions of CCPs were unbundled and the ownership and funding structures that best suit their individual characteristics were selected. Functions that are critical for the provision of financial stability might suggest some form of public sector involvement, whereas other services might lend themselves to a for-profit or traditional club model.},

We compare the total capital and collateral costs when banks transact fully bilaterally and when they clear all contracts through CCPs.

Typically, in margin systems, each risk factor is filtered individually so that the computational burden increases linearly as the number of risk factors grows. We propose an alternative method that filters historical returns using latent risk factors derived from principal component analysis. We compare this method's performance with "traditional" FHS for different simulated and constructed portfolios. The proposed method performs much better when there are large changes in correlation. It also performs well when that is not the case, although some care needs to be taken with certain concentrated portfolios. At the same time, the computational requirements can be reduced significantly. Backtesting comparisons are performed using data from 2020 when markets were stressed by the COVID-19 crisis.},

The sizable price dislocations registered on these occasions suggested that traditional risk models may not be fully equipped to capture such breakdowns. Because correlations are directly impacted by the statistical properties of each variable, any model that lacks the capacity to deal with nonstationarity may inappropriately represent correlations or their alterations. Using an approach that combines a generalized autoregressive conditional heteroscedasticity model with dynamic conditional correlation (GARCH-DCC) to accommodate such properties, we aim to study correlation behavior during adverse market conditions and the potential impact on central counterparty margins. We propose a case study on energy commodities, with a specific focus on spread positions for the electricity market. The analysis suggests that correlation breakdowns are more frequent than traditionally expected. When different types of shocks (ie, those of September 2018 and March–May 2020) are considered, it becomes evident that while the magnitudes of the breakdowns may differ, their cycles present a number of similarities. We also recognize the potentially increased margin procyclicality that may be entailed by model corrections to deal with correlation breakdowns, highlighting the challenges of balancing margin responsiveness and stability during adverse market conditions.},

The economy is populated by two types of agents: a borrower and lender. The borrower is subject to limited commitment and holds private information about the severity of such lack of commitment. The lender can acquire information at a cost about the commitment of the borrower,which affects the assessment of counterparty risk. When truthful revelation by the borrower is not incentive compatible, the mechanism designer optimally trades off the value of information about the lack of commitment of the borrower withthe cost of incentivizing the lender to acquire such information. Central clearing of these financial contracts through a central counterparty (CCP) allows lendersto mutualize their counterparty risks, but this insurance may weaken incentivesto acquire and reveal information about such risks. If information acquisition isincentive compatible, then lenders choose central clearing. If it is not, they mayprefer bilateral clearing to prevent strategic default by borrowers and to econo-mize on costly collateral. Central clearing is analyzed under different institutional features observed in financial markets, which place different restrictions on the contract space in the mechanism design problem. The interaction between the costly information acquisition and the limited commitment friction differs significantly in each clearing arrangement and in each set of restrictions. This results in novel lessons about the desirability of central versus bilateral clearing depending on traders' characteristics and the institutional features depening the operation of the CCP.},

  abstract  = {Financial network analysis is used to provide firm level bottom-up holistic visualizations of interconnections of financial obligations in global OTC derivatives markets. This helps to identify Systemically Important Financial Intermediaries (SIFIs), analyse the nature of contagion propagation, and also monitor and design ways of increasing robustness in the network. Based on 2009 FDIC and individually collected firm level data covering gross notional, gross positive (negative) fair value and the netted derivatives assets and liabilities for 202 financial firms which includes 20 SIFIs, the bilateral flows are empirically calibrated to reflect data-based constraints. This produces a tiered network with a distinct highly clustered central core of 12 SIFIs that account for 78 percent of all bilateral exposures and a large number of financial intermediaries (FIs) on the periphery. The topology of the network results in the "Too- Interconnected-To-Fail" (TITF) phenomenon in that the failure of any member of the central tier will bring down other members with the contagion coming to an abrupt end when the "super-spreaders" have demised. As these SIFIs account for the bulk of capital in the system, ipso facto no bank among the top tier can be allowed to fail, highlighting the untenable implicit socialized guarantees needed for these markets to operate at their current levels. Systemic risk costs of highly connected SIFIs nodes are not priced into their holding of capital or collateral. An eigenvector centrality based "super-spreader" tax has been designed and tested for its capacity to reduce the potential socialized losses from failure of SIFIs},

  abstract  = {Clearing houses, or CCPs, were among the very few organisations to emerge from the global financial crisis with their standing enhanced. In the chaotic aftermath of the bankruptcy of Lehman Brothers, they successfully completed trades worth trillions of dollars in a multitude of financial instruments across listed and over-the-counter markets, and so helped avert financial Armageddon.
That success transformed the business of clearing. Governments and regulators around the world gave CCPs and the clearing services they provide a front-line role in protecting the global economy from future excesses of finance. CCPs, which mitigate risk in financial markets, responded by greatly expanding their activities, notably in markets for over-the-counter derivatives, and often in fierce competition with one another.
In The Risk Controllers, journalist and author Peter Norman describes how CCPs operate, how they handled the Lehman default, and the challenges they now face. Because central counterparty clearing is a complex business with a long history that continues to influence decisions and structures even in today’s fast changing world, The Risk Controllers explores the development of CCPs and clearing from the earliest times to the present.
It draws on the experiences of the people who helped to shape the business of clearing today. It sets the development of CCPs and clearing in the broader context of changes in society, politics and regulation. The book examines turning points, such as the 1987 stock market crash, that set clearing on a new path and the impact of long running trends, including the exponential growth of computer power and the ebb and flow of globalisation.
Written in non-technical language, The Risk Controllers provides a unique and accessible guide to CCPs and clearing. It is essential reading for clearing professionals, legislators and regulators whose job it is to take this vitally important business into the future.},

  abstract = {This Article challenges the academic and policy consensus that clearinghousesa dequately mitigate the risks of trading credit derivatives. The Articleadvances two arguments. First, scholars have devoted little attention to the risks posed by underlying assets (such as mortgage loans) that the credit derivative references and the impact that these risks have on the clearinghouse. Credit derivatives enable the economic risk of debt to be separated from the legal rights attaching to that debt. This separation affects the clearinghouse profoundly. As a contract party to each trade it processes, the clearinghouse can be saddled with the economic risk of underlying debt without the legalrights necessary to mitigate its exposure. If a clearinghouse cannot manageits risks, the consequences are invariably systemic and enormously costly to the taxpayer Second, the Article shows that the clearinghouse's structure exposes its members to complex incentives that (1) encourage risk taking by subsidizing and mutualizing default losses; (2) shift the private costs of monitoring to the clearinghouse and thereby allow members to underinvest in due diligence; and (3) cause members to place undue reliance on information provided by third parties that is often colored by the strategic motives of the partiesproviding it.
This Article concludes with a proposal for a new paradigm for the clearinghouse.This new model seeks to repair the consequences of separating economic risks from legal rights, which are caused by the use of the credit derivative. It also seeks to mitigate the distorted incentives affecting clearinghouse members. With reforms in place that allow for improved policing of its exposures, the clearinghouse will become a more robust institution that is better positioned to control lax underwriting standards accompanying the extension of credit.},

  abstract = {A dramatic shift in the economic and power structure of the securities industry is currently in progress. Traditionally, stock and futures exchanges have operated in the form of non-profit mutual or membership organizations. To the extent market power was not curtailed by competition or regulation, mutual governance gave specialist or market maker members of an exchange control of the price, quality and range of services produced by the exchange. Exchange profits were returned to broker and dealer members in the form of lower access fees or trading profits. Further, exchanges have long operated as self-regulatory organizations (SROs) with members contributing their time to governance and self-regulation to make exchanges more effective and more profitable. Selfregulation was enshrined in the federal securities laws and commodity laws, with oversight by the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) and the Commodity Futures Trading Commission.
The pressure to reduce trading execution costs and the demands for technological innovation are among the causes leading to the demutualization of exchanges. These developments are raising many market structure issues. These include regulation of electronic communication networks; market fragmentation; linkages; market information fees and other exchange revenues; the fair treatment of customer orders; and perhaps most importantly, the future of selfregulation. New competitive strategies by exchanges and their members, including demutualization, are raising serious conflicts of interest questions about self-regulation.
This Article will argue that the SEC is attempting to re-regulate market structure under a command and control model pursuant to the national market system provisions injected into the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 in 1975 at a time when the monopoly trading regime which led to the national market system mandate is breaking down. An interesting and relevant question this Article will pose is whether current trading technologies and the competition these technologies have engendered should lead to a reduction of SEC market regulation, rather than the increase in regulation envisioned by current SEC concept and rulemaking releases, so that competition rather than regulation can determine outcomes.
This Article will also inquire about the future of self-regulation and exchange governance in a world where stock and commodities exchanges are not mutual organizations. Although exchanges have long operated as SROs, there are serious questions as to whether they will be able to continue to do so after demutualization.},

  abstract  = {Consolidation in the financial industry threatens competition and increases systemic risk. Recently, banks have seen both high-profile mergers and spectacular failures, prompting a flurry of regulatory responses. Yet consolidation has not been as closely scrutinized for clearinghouses, which facilitate trading in securities and derivatives products. These nonbank intermediaries can be thought of as middlemen who collect deposits to ensure that each buyer and seller has the wherewithal to uphold its end of the deal. Clearinghouses mitigate the credit risks that buyers and sellers would face if they dealt directly with each other.
Yet here lies the dilemma: large clearinghouses reduce credit risk, but they heighten systemic risk since the collapse of one such entity threatens the entire financial system. While regulators have tackled the systemic risks posed by large banks, the systemic risks of these nonbank intermediaries have received less attention. In fact, financial reform has spurred clearinghouse growth and consolidation.
This Article examines the paradoxical treatment of regulators toward the systemic risks of clearinghouses and banks. It explores two fundamental questions: Why does the paradox exist, and who benefits from it? This Article borrows from antitrust to offer a framework for ensuring that the entities that control a large clearinghouse (large, heavily regulated banks) do not abuse that clearinghouse’s market dominance.},

A key feature of this framework is a requirement that many of these derivatives be cleared through central counterparty clearinghouses. Clearinghouses have long played a stabilizing force in many markets, but Dodd-Frank's regulatory mandate may adversely affect the way they operate. Risk management by clearinghouses and market participants could suffer, and improper risks could find their way into clearinghouses. If a clearinghouse were to fail, there would be tremendous pressure for the government to bail it out in the name of financial stability. Dodd-Frank's derivatives framework should be reconsidered before it destabilizes the financial system. A better approach would empower market participants to decide whether to use clearinghouses and would allow clearinghouses the regulatory latitude to effectively manage their risks.},

  abstract  = {This note analyzes the effectiveness of derivatives clearinghouses in decreasing systemic risk upon a counterparty default. The analysis first explains how a derivatives clearinghouse can successfully reduce systemic risk by analyzing LCH. Clearnet's management of the Lehman default in 2008. Next, the analysis demonstrates that if a clearinghouse could not manage a default and became insolvent, systemic risk would greatly increase. Rather than containing the impact of a counterparty default, an insolvent clearinghouse would enhance systemic risk because the two existing resolution regimes, the Bankruptcy Code and the Dodd-Frank Orderly Liquidation Authority, could not successfully unwind the institution. The primary contribution of this Note is identifying that an insolvent derivatives clearinghouse creates an unsolvable problem with respect to resolution: untangling the derivatives trades will inevitably take more than a day, but if sorting out the portfolios takes even a few days, clearing members will start a run on the clearinghouse. The resulting enhanced systemic risk would necessitate government intervention. A major derivatives clearinghouse would be too big to fail. Accordingly, this Note proposes two recommendations to ensure that derivatives clearinghouses effectively reduce systemic risk. Regulators should: \(1\) minimize the risk of clearinghouse insolvency through strict collateral, capital, and default management requirements, and \(2\) create an ex ante guarantee fund to serve as a government backstop and provide liquidity to an insolvent derivatives clearinghouse, thereby avoiding enhanced systemic risk.},

We contrast the collateral necessary between bilateral partners with that required when multilateral netting occurs. Optimal margin levels balance the deadweight costs of default against the opportunity costs of holding additional margin. Once creasted, it may be optimal for the clearinghouse to monitor the financial condition of its members. If undertaken, monitoring will reduce the amount of margin required but need not affect the probability of default. Once created, it becomes optimal for the clearinghouse membership to expel defaulting members. This reduces the probability of default. Our empirical tests suggest that the opportunity cost of margin plays an important role in clearinghouse behavior particularly their determination of margin amounts. The relationship between volatility and margins suggests that participants face an upward-sloping opportunity cost of margin. This appears to dominate the effects that monitoring and expulsion might have on margin setting.},

In Making Failure Feasible, the contributors expand on their proposal to improve the prospect that our largest financial institutions—particularly with prebankruptcy planning—could be successfully reorganized or liquidated pursuant to the rule of law and, in doing so, both make resolution planning pursuant to Title I of Dodd-Frank more fruitful and make reliance on administrative proceedings pursuant to Title II of Dodd-Frank largely unnecessary. This book highlights the problems of dealing with large financial institutions in distress, without incurring either spillover distress to other institutions or relying on government bailout, and Chapter 14’s responses to those twin issues, as well as recommending other measures that would facilitate successful resolutions. The contributors first outline the basic features of Chapter 14 as originally proposed in 2012 vis-à-vis the reorganization or liquidation of an operating company and point to their continuation as well as additional features to ensure the quick resolution of large financial institutions that would not depend on government discretion and would mesh with emerging ideas about cross-border resolution. The remaining chapters provide the context for reform, outline the fundamental principles of reform, show how reform would work in practice, and show how Chapter 14, as envisioned in this book, would be a substantial advance on administrative-focused resolution procedures.},
